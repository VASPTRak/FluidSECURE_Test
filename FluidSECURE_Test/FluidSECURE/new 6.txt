Hi Eric,

Ok we will move O&M module icon to the right of Edit Project .

We have  checked in latest changes to TFS which are necessary for adding SharpSpringID(bigint) to the AspNetUsers table.
Database script for this checkin can be found on path “DBScripts\Update Scripts\calQflo_20180503.sql”

For adding columns to AspNetUses table following procedure is needed to be followed(which I have already taken care of and updated the changes to TFS):
1.	Add property for the column which is needed to be added to IdentityModels.cs – ApplicationUser class.
2.	Then from Package Manage Console run command “Enable-Migrations”
3.	Then run command Add-Migration – after this command you have to give name for the current migration transaction.
4.	Then run command “Update-Database” 
5.	Finally update the entity for the AspNetUsers table.

Related to adding adding O&M module:
Is this Operations & Maintenance manual is common for all sizing’s? If not, is there any naming convention for the O&M names like we have for the CAD drawing files?
Please let us know more about this, if you provide us some sample O&M files then it will help us understand it better.
Also let us know that in which folder should we keep these O&M files.

We are working on the remaining points we will get back to you once completed.

Regards.


Hi Eric,

We have checked in latest code to TFS, there is no need of database script for this check-in.

We have added sharp spring tracking script for all pages. 
We did not find any way to add user’s email address in tracking request, we may need to get help for this from sharp spring.

We have added below script block for tracking:
       var ss = ss || [];
       _ss.push(['_setDomain', 'https://koi-3QNCSQ06VG.marketingautomation.services/net']);
       _ss.push(['_setAccount', 'KOI-3YZTY05W9U']);
       _ss.push(['_trackPageView']);
       (function () {
              var ss = document.createElement('script');
              ss.type = 'text/javascript'; ss.async = true;
              ss.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://' : 'http://') + 'koi-3QNCSQ06VG.marketingautomation.services/client/ss.js?ver=1.1.1';
              var scr = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
              scr.parentNode.insertBefore(ss, scr);
       })();

After we add tracking script on the pages with password involved below warning is getting logged in browser  console:
This page includes a password or credit card input in a non-secure context. A warning has been added to the URL bar. For more information, see https://goo.gl/zmWq3m.
